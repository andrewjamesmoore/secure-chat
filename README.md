# Secure Chat (Go)

### A simple secure chat server and client built with Go using TLS.  
This started as a simple experiment to better understand how TCP works under the hood and learn some Go in the process.

### What it does
- TLS-encrypted server/client communication
- Prompts users for a username
- Broadcasts messages to all connected users
- Built with `net`, `tls`, and Go’s standard library — no external packages
